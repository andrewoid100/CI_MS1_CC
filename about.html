                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Cat's Corner was started in 2002 by a collection of veterinary professionals, adoption charities, rescue charities and a few friends in the baking industry.</p>

                <p>We would often meet up for coffee in our cat shelter and found that the cats made our visits and gatherings quite therapuetic. Our friends loved our cats and often found good support animals by visiting.
                </br>One day we decided we could try and open a cat cafe to make a little extra money to cover costs and house our cats.
                </br>It was quite a quick way for our adoption partners to find foster homes for our cats. Soon after, we introduced more hot meals and foods into the cafe and we noticed it had suddenly became similar to that of a restaurant than a cafe and now, we have one of the most successful cat businesses in the area of Manchester. In fact, we are yet to find a similar business in all of England(we'll keep looking).
