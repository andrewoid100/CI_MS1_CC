            <p>Come get to know our lovely caretakers. We have a lovely and friendly range of cats to meet. All are friendly. With ranging personalities, our cats are suitable for all types of guests, those who are not used to being around animals or pets as much and those who love a bit of personal contact. Come and meet us in person to get to know them more.
            All of our cats are fully vetted.

                    <p>Nala is a wise and friendly cat. Stoic and watchful, she is always looking out for others to keep them out of trouble.<br>
                    She also has an eye for previously warmed up seats too.<br>
                    <br>Nala is a great companion for those who are not very used to being around animals or pets, or perhaps don't want to get too close. Warm, kind and loving, she is respectful of personal space and boundaries.</p>
